# \*NixConnect

This is a project created by me. Yes, me. Why should you care? I don't know, but social media has been a toxic hellstew of negativity and apocalyptic scenarios, so I did my part in mitigating by creating \*NixConnect! Yes, the name implies a certain demographic in mind, but think about it like this - computers should be returned back to their basics. Actually, not really. Returning to basics would have meant I would have had to write \*NixConnect in C. But it's whatever, this is your space of peace and quiet to come to after roaming the safari of the interwebs all day long :)

I am not sure if I have put a licence on this baby, I am going to check that out after finishing this README file.
