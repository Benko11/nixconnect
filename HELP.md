# Using \*NixConnect

We are striving to make the application as easy to use for you as possible, however we won't beat around the bush here; \*NixConnect does have its specifities to make it feel like a retro application that has all the capabilities of a fully-fledged desktop application.

## Posts

You can send a post by typing in your message and clicking on 'Post'.
**Tip:** All of the messages use Markdown formatting.

You can _interact_ with posts, simply by **right-clicking** anywhere on the post. This will open a context menu giving you some options. Selecting an option from the menu performs the action and closes the menu automatically for you; just like you are used to from desktop operating systems.

On touchscreens (not iOS) you can long-press the post to trigger the context-menu.
